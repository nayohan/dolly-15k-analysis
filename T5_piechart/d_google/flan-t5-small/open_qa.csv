"There are a number of reasons why you should have kids. The first is that it's not possible for children to grow up in the same age group as their parents, so they may be too young and need help with things like schoolwork or other personal needs (like homework). If your child has an older brother/girlfriend who lives alone at home then this could mean having his own kiddo-child relationship between them!"
